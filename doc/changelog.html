<p><strong>CHANGELOG (${date}):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Java 8 is now required. (Java 7 is no longer supported.)</li>
    <li>Performance enhancements, including less memory use, faster loading, reduced CPU usage. Especially noticable
        with larger texture
        packs.
    </li>
    <li>New Minimap/Fullscreen Map option: "Mob Display". The new "Dot" option offers a clean look with a way to see mob
        elevation relative to you.
        The "Icon" option displays mob icons like older versions of JourneyMap. Use the Options Manager to set your
        preferences.
    </li>
    <li>Mods and Resource Packs can now add their own mob icons.
        See <a href="http://journeymap.info/Custom_Mob_Icon_Sets">http://journeymap.info/Custom_Mob_Icon_Sets</a> for
        details.
    </li>
    <li>New features/permissions for JourneyMapServer, including Waypoint Teleporting. Server admins can now fine-tune
        radar and
        mapping permissions on a per-dimension basis.
        See <a href="http://journeymap.info/Support">http://journeymap.info/JourneyMapServer</a> for details.
    </li>
    <li>JourneyMap is no longer built twice as FairPlay and Unlimited Editions. If you're in singleplayer, use the
        Options Manager to turn off features you don't want. If you're in multiplayer, your server admin can use
        JourneyMapServer to turn off features they don't want.
    </li>
    <li>Improved support for coloring blocks in some mods like AbyssalCraft that use Material.GRASS but don't inherit
        from Block.grass.
    </li>
    <li>Normal surface/cave mapping is now supported in dimensions without a sky, instead of just cave mapping.
    </li>
    <li>Web Map simplified to simply show player location and waypoints. Mob radar no longer supported.
    </li>
    <li>Bugfix: Lag from overzealous logging on texturepack changes or unloading dimensions.
    </li>
    <li>Bugfix: Mapping would stop/start when a dimension unloaded that the player wasn't even in. (For example, when
        pushing a mob through a Nether portal, the Nether would load/unload.)
    </li>
</ul>
