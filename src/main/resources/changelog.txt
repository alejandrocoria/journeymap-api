## Requirements:

- Minecraft @MCVERSION@
- Forge-@FORGEVERSION@ or later (http://files.minecraftforge.net/)

## Changelog for JourneyMap @JMVERSION@:
- New UI:  General Display / Map Style... lets you:
-- Toggle contour mapping of the ocean floor (bathymetry)
-- Toggle transparency of blocks
-- Toggle mapping of plants (AKA Nude Maps)
-- Toggle mapping of crops
- Bugfix from Alpha 3:  Full-screen map player locator (self) didn't move when panning the map.
- Change: Significant changes in the way chunk data is cached/checked for being stale.  Should provide more consistent map coverage.  This may make things unstable, perform badly, use insane amounts or memory, or possibly work as intended.

## Changelog for JourneyMap 4.1.0alpha3:
- Bugfix: Missing message keys fixed
- Waypoint Editor used wrong coordinates when based on player's position.

## Changelog for JourneyMap 4.1.0alpha2:

- Bugfix: Surrounding chunks weren't force-updated far enough when underground
- Bugfix: Self icon in full-screen map didn't show correct rotation
- Bugfix: Nether/End renderers were throwing errors

## Changelog for JourneyMap 4.1.0alpha1:

### Completely Rewritten Map Algorithms
- Transparency and luminosity (especially under water) are vastly improved
- Faster cave mapping algorithm
- Higher-detail Nether and End mapping
- Night map light levels and colors are now closer to how they appear in-game

### New Feature: Minimap Terrain Transparency
- MiniMap Options now allows you to choose how opaque/transparent the mapped terrain appears

### New Feature: Optional Flat (2D) Mob Icons
- General Display Options lets you choose between the new 2D mob icons and the pre-existing 3D icons
- The Minimap now uses 2D icons by default, but you can change it back under General Display Options
- The Web Map can also change its mob icon set (Using the options menu in your browser)
- Don't like an icon?  Find it in journeyMap/icon/entity/[setname]/ and replace it with something you prefer. Icons must be in PNG format. Recommended size is 16x16 pixels.

### New feature: Custom Icon Set support
- To get started: Copy and rename the journeyMap/icon/entity/2D/ folder to journeyMap/icon/entity/[new set name]/, then replace the existing icons with your own.
- Icons must be in PNG format. Recommended size is 16x16 pixels.
- Afer you restart Minecraft, the General Display Options screen or MiniMap Options screen will allow you to select your new custom icon set.

### MiniMap Improvements
- New "Custom Size": Choose your own MiniMap size between 64px and 1024px
- New transparency option: Choose to make the MiniMap partially transparent
- Most MiniMap key combinations no longer require you to press CTRL / COMMMAND
- MiniMap switches between cave/surface mapping more quickly
- MiniMap refreshes neighboring tiles more quickly when zoomed in.

- MiniMap zoom setting and Full-screen Map zoom setting are now saved between sessions.
- Minimap's Y coordinate now reflects feet position, not eye position
